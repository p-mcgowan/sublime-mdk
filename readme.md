# Sublime SE MDK (title pending)

Steal the MDK compiler for Visual Studio, use in sublime build to get errors and whatnot.
May need to install msbuild deps (see https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki/Getting-Started)

- Copy folder into sublime/packages/
- Open APPDATA/Roaming/SpaceEngineers/IngameScripts/local/script-folder
- (optionally) add mdk.sublime-settings to the folder
- Select Tools -> Build System -> se-mdk
- Profit
